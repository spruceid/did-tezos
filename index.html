    <p> <a href="https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos">Tezos</a> is an open-source
        blockchain protocol that has a formalized process for upgrades and uses
        a virtual machine language called Michelson, which is designed to
        support formal verification using proof assistants. It can be used for
        DID creation and management compatible with the issuance, storage, and
        verification of Verifiable Credentials, achieving a pragmatic balance
        across privacy, decentralization, and accessibility for general purpose
        use in Internet scale consumer and B2B applications.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <section>
  <h3>Problem statement</h3>
  <p> did-core specifies that DIDs are required to implement
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#resolution">DID Resolution</a>.
      As per the DID Decentralized Rubric, properties of a DID method may range
      from:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-managed to controlled by a single platform.</li>
    <li>Spread across thousands of independent servers to hosted on a single
        mainframe.</li>
    <li>Private to select parties to visible across the entire Internet.</li>
    <li>Open for use by anyone to gatekeeped by signed legal documents.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> We seek to specify a DID method with pragmatic trade-offs across privacy,
      decentralization, and accessibility, suitable for use in Internet scale
      consumer and B2B applications. To accomplish this, the DID method
      resolves across tiered layers of data storage, each with different
      characteristics, but all at the ultimate control of the user.
  </p>
  <p> In this document, we specify the syntax for Tezos DIDs, architecture of
      tiered resolution, and the four basic CRUD operations (create, read,
      update, deactivate) required by did-core. We also provide discussion on
      privacy implications, code snippets, and guidelines for implementers.
  </p>

  <section>
  <h3>Why a Tezos DID Method?</h3>
  <p> For purposes of DID management, the relevant properties provided by the
      Tezos blockchain are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Public and highly available</b>: The Tezos <code>mainnet</code>
        instance has thousands of independently controlled active nodes
        and validators able to share full transaction histories with any
        requesting peer, requiring only an Internet connection. This allows
        DIDs based on Tezos transactions, such as those created by the method
        described in this document, to achieve high accessibility and
        availability.</li>
    <li><b>Permissionless</b>: Anyone is able to also write to the Tezos
        blockchain instances using the <code>XTZ</code> cryptocurrency to
        pay transaction fees. This cryptocurrency can be received by anyone
        directly from any peer possessing it, and it is also widely
        available for purchase on major cryptocurrency exchanges. In an
        upcoming protocol upgrade, <a>permits</a> will allow for third
        parties to pay transaction fees on behalf of others.</li>
    <li><b>Censorship resistant</b>: The protocol uses cryptography to
        maintain integrity across all transactions, and the transaction history
        may be fully replicated from any single node out of thousands, using
        commodity hardware. The integrity of the network is maintained using a
        proof of stake consensus algorithm, and the cost to attack the network
        is prohibitively expensive for many attack vectors, as described in the
        following section.</li>
    <li><b>Upgradable</b>: The Tezos protocol and virtual machine language
        Michelson can be upgraded without disruption to the network, and this
        has been completed successfully eight times since its launch, with
        mechanisms to correct for human errors. To illustrate new features
        available via protocol upgrades, an upcoming protocol upgrade is adding
        shielded transactions to the base protocol to enable privacy-enhanced
        operations and scalability. These improvements can enhance DID and
        Verifiable Credential functionality and performance.</li>
    <li><b>Up to date</b>: Tezos has a 60-second block time, which is able to
        ensure that resolved Tezos-based DID documents are up to date within
        reasonable time bounds for many use cases.</li>
    <li><b>Formally verifiable</b>: Michelson, the virtual machine language
        used by Tezos, is designed to facilitate formal verification using
        proof assistant frameworks, such as Mi-Cho-Coq. It is possible to
        formally verify some properties of software used for DID management, or
        even to create a full specification.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3>Tezos Settlement Finality</h3>
  <p> Implementations of the Tezos blockchain exist across several instances,
      with the instance called <code>mainnet</code> concentrating economic
      incentives and therefore stability to ensure properties useful to DID
      management. The cost of a 51 percent attack on Tezos <code>mainnet</code> to
      disrupt these properties was approximately (USD) $1,000,000,000 at the time
      of writing (October 2020). This economic incentives-based security model has
      maintained the system's integrity over two years, since its launch on
      September 2018.

      <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
      <p>Design criteria are the explicit goals that a project must achieve in
      order to be successful. The Design Criteria of the Tezos DID Method are
      the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Secure</b>. It will pursue the correct use of cryptography, proper
            authentication and authorizations for protected actions such as key
            rotations, and creation of guidelines for safe use.</li>
        <li><b>Simple</b>. It will be straightforward for implementers to interpret
            and build. End users will be able to quickly understand its utility
            upon glance and without reading the full specification.</li>
        <li><b>Inclusive</b>. It will allow every account on Tezos, whether it
            has an on-chain transaction history or not, to use DIDs such as
            in the issuance, storage, and presentation of Verifiable
            Credentials or use of DIDComm for secure and private DID-to-DID
            communications.</li>
        <li><b>Privacy preserving</b>. It will follow principles of information
            minimization and create as few public uncensorable on-chain
            artifacts as possible, providing off-chain alternatives that are
            more peer-to-peer when possible.</li>
        <li><b>Usable and compatible</b>. It will be interoperable with
            existing DID methods and adjacent standards. DIDs using this method
            will be widely resolvable.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Tezos DID Scheme</h2>
      <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>tz</code>.
         A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the prefix
         <code>did:tz</code>. As per the DID specification, this string MUST be
         in lowercase.</p>
      <section>
      <h3>Syntax and Interpretation</h3>
      <p>The full Tezos DID scheme is defined by the following
         <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/std68">ABNF</a>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
tezos-did   = "did:tz:" [ network ":" ] address
network     = 1*(lower-char / digit)
address     = prefix 33*33base58-char
prefix      = "tz1" / "tz2" / "tz3" / "KT1"
base58-char = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
              "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" /
              "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q" / "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" /
              "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" /
              "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" /
              "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" / "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" /
              "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"
lower-char  = %x61-7A  ; a-z
digit       = %x30-39  ; 0-9
      </code></pre>
      <p>All Tezos DIDs use base58 encoding for the <code>address</code> rule.
         base58 is an encoding scheme similar to base64, first used by Bitcoin,
         disallowing characters that may be misinterpreted by the human eye,
         specifically <code>O</code>&nbsp;(uppercase&nbsp;'<code>o</code>'),
         <code>0</code>&nbsp;(the&nbsp;digit&nbsp;zero),
         <code>I</code>&nbsp;(uppercase&nbsp;'<code>i</code>'), and
         <code>l</code>&nbsp;(lowercase&nbsp;'<code>L</code>').
         <br/> <br/> The <code>network</code> rule MAY be used to indicate
         which Tezos instance the DID references. If it is not present, then
         the instance is assumed to be <code>mainnet</code>. Other known test
         networks include <code>dalphanet</code>, <code>carthage</code>,
         and <code>labnet</code>. The number of test networks is expected to
         grow.</p>

      <section>
      <h4>Note: registry for testnets?</h4>
      <p>What is the process for registering a new test network? Is there any
         existing registry of testnets, and how to access them? How can this be
         official and community-managed? Tezos User Group?</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h4>Note: account character length not documented</h4>
      <p>We assume the account portion is 36 bytes, 3 bytes for the prefix and
          33 bytes for the suffix, but this is not known to be guaranteed at
          this time within the Tezos documentation.</p>

      <h3>Background on Tezos Addresses</h3>
        <p> Tezos addresses can exist as either accounts or smart contracts.
            Tezos accounts are generated from public keys. The three character
            prefix, <code>tz1</code>, <code>tz2</code>, or <code>tz3</code>,
            indicate which signature system and elliptic curve are used. The
            prefix of <code>KT1</code> denotes a Tezos smart contract, which do
            not have an implied public-private key pair. (Note that this
            specification does not support the prefix <code>btz1</code> used
            for blinded accounts.) Tezos supports three public key signature
            systems for its accounts, each with a different elliptic curve:

                It is currently supported in the Apple CryptoKit, Android
                KeyStore, and is widely used in TLS. In Tezos, this curve is used
                with ECDSA. The cryptography community has

          </tr>
        </table>

        <section>
        <h4>Note: signature system not documented</h4>
        <p>While <code>Ed25519</code> does specify the use of Curve25519 with
           SHA-512 and EdDSA, it is not currently specified in the Tezos
           documentation that <code>secp256k1</code> or <code>P-256</code> are
           necessarily used with ECDSA. This is just the implied case with
           existing implementations. The latter two are technically curves and
           not public key signature systems, as is the case with
           <code>Ed25519</code>. We should move to document signature
           systems for purposes of interoperability and fostering diversity in
           compliant Tezos shell implementations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h4>Note: account generation algorithm is undocumented</h4>
        <p>All known major Tezos implementations (e.g., pytez, Tezos shell, and
           TezEdge) use <code>blake2b</code> to hash the public key with a
           <i>digest size</i> of 20 bytes. This hash is then base58 encoded.
           While this methodology is canonical across implementations, it is
           not specified in the Tezos documentation as required.  For example,
           use of the sha512 that is base58 encoded is a plausible
           representation as per the documentation alone.  This is related to
           the note about variable account character length as a possible
           direct cause.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h4>Note: btz1 "blinded" signatures are undocumented</h4>
        <p>There is scarce mention of <code>btz1</code> "blinded" account
           prefixes other than a few loose strands of documentation and
           historical mentions from around 2018. It is assumed that they are
           not in active use today and therefore not relevant to this
           specification. We have an opportunity to document this and its
           historical significance to reduce future confusion.</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p> The objective for the Tezos DID Method is to utilize Tezos accounts and
        smart contract addresses in a coherent manner to manage DID documents
        while adhering to this document's Design Criteria, including security,
        privacy, and simplicity. For simplicity, Tezos DIDs only support a
        single active public key and service endpoint at a time. In this
        section, we describe major architectural patterns utilized in its DID
        operations.
    </p>

    <section> <!-- h3 -->
    <h3>Tiered DID Resolution</h3>
    <p> DID resolution occurs sequentially across the following ordered layers
        of data sources, known as resolution layers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Implied DID Document.</li>
      <li>Corresponding on-chain smart contract known as a DID Manager.</li>
      <li>Corresponding off-chain DID document signed updates.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> DID resolvers must move sequentially through all resolution layers to
        incrementally build a DID document, and they fail upon the first
        encountered inconsistency, producing an error result and no DID
        document. Success can only be achieved after processing all resolution
        layers.

    <section> <!-- h4 -->
    <h4>Absence of data sources</h4>
    <p> The absence of a data source is <b>not</b> considered an inconsistency,
        and the resolver simply disregards the absent data source, moving on to
        the next data source in the sequence. An example of an inconsistency is
        a signed JSON patch that fails an integrity check or uses an unexpected
        key.
    </p>
    </section> <!-- h4 -->
    <section> <!-- h4 -->
    <h4>Tezos addresses: accounts vs. smart contracts</h4>
    <p> A Tezos address may represent either an account, beginning with
        <code>tz1</code>, <code>tz2</code>, or <code>tz3</code>, or a smart
        contract, beginning with <code>KT1</code>. When they populate the
        <code>address</code> ABNF rule in DIDs, they are known as account
        address-based DIDs and smart contract address-based DIDs, respectively.
    </p>
    <p> Smart contracts do not come with implied key pairs, so their implied
        DID document is absent. Furthermore, they cannot have off-chain signed
        updates without deployment, as currently, smart contract addresses
        cannot be known prior to deployment. Therefore, smart contract
        address-based DIDs must always be deployed prior to use.
    </p>
    </section> <!-- h4 -->
    </section> <!-- h3 -->
    <section> <!-- h3 -->
    <h3>Implied DID Document</h3>
    <p> For Tezos account address-based DIDs with addresses starting with
        <code>tz1</code>, <code>tz2</code>, or <code>tz3</code>, DID document
        resolution is possible without committing any Tezos blockchain
        transactions to preserve privacy and save costs. Because all
        <code>mainnet</code> blockchain transactions are public, immutable, and
        fee-based, it is recommended to exercise extreme caution and store the
        absolute minimum amount of information on-chain.
    </p>

    <section>
    <h4>Deriving DID Documents</h4>
    <p> At this resolution layer, DID document is derived by <i>implying</i>
        values from a Tezos account address-based DID, such as
        <code>did:tz:mainnet:tz1TzrmTBSuiVHV2VfMnGRMYvTEPCP42oSM8</code>, which
        matches the <code>account</code> and optional <code>network</code>
        rules in the DID Scheme ABNF. This value is then used within the DID
        document <code>authentication</code> section as the
        <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/#blockchainAccountId"><code>blockchainAccountId</code></a>
        as specified in the
        <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a>.
        A DID resolver could take the example DID and generate the following
        DID document without incorporating any data from blockchain
        transactions:
    </p>
    <code><pre>
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:tz:mainnet:tz1TzrmTBSuiVHV2VfMnGRMYvTEPCP42oSM8",
  "authentication": [{
    "id": "did:tz:mainnet:tz1TzrmTBSuiVHV2VfMnGRMYvTEPCP42oSM8#blockchainAccountId",
    "type": "Ed25519PublicKeyBLAKE2BDigestSize20Base58CheckEncoded2020",
    "controller": "did:tz:mainnet:tz1TzrmTBSuiVHV2VfMnGRMYvTEPCP42oSM8",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV",
    "blockchainAccountId": "tz1TzrmTBSuiVHV2VfMnGRMYvTEPCP42oSM8@tezos:mainnet"
  }]
}
    </pre></code>
    <p> However, the DID resolver must then check the live specified Tezos
        blockchain instance for a DID Manager, which is defined in the next
        section.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section> <!-- h4 -->
    <h4>Note: undefined LD-Proof signature suites ("type") for tz1/tz2/tz3</h4>
    <p>This is related to the example entries found for 
       <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/#blockchainAccountId"><code>blockchainAccountId</code></a>.
       We need to define the <code>type</code> for use with Ed25519-based
       <code>tz1</code> Tezos accounts. We should also consider inclusion of
       <code>tezosAddress</code> for the secp256k1/ECDSA-based
       <code>tz2</code> into the
       <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/EcdsaSecp256k1RecoverySignature2020">EcdsaSecp256k1RecoverySignature</a> LD-Proof signature suite.

    <h3>DID Manager Smart Contract</h3>
    <p> DID Managers are smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain that implement
        TZIP-19, with Michelson annotations satisfying the following abstract
        function interface:
    </p>
    <code><pre>
rotateAuthentication :: (VerificationMethod, RotationSignature) => ()
getAuthentication :: () => VerificationMethod
rotateService :: (Service, RotationSignature) => ()
getService :: () => Service
    </pre></code>

    <p> <code>rotateAuthentication</code> updates the verification method used
        for authentication, such as a public key or public key digest along
        with its verification method type. It may be called by anyone, but
        requires a valid <code>RotationSignature</code>. This function is used
        by the update operation to modify the <code>authentication</code>
        property in a DID document.
    </p>

    <p> <code>rotateService</code> updates the single service endpoint, which is
        a URI with a service endpoint type. It may be called by anyone, but
        requires a valid <code>RotationSignature</code>. This function is used
        by the update operation to modify the <code>service</code> property in
        a DID document.
    </p>

    <p> The <code>RotationSignature</code> input parameter contains the
        signature of the data produced by concatenating the byte
        representations of the current value's message digest, next value,
        current chain identifier, and current rotation count. Including the
        chain identifier prevents impersonating the controller on a different
        chain. The current rotation count is defined as the sum total of
        successfully executed calls to both <code>rotateAuthentication</code>
        and <code>rotateService</code> to date. For example, if each function
        were successfully executed exactly once, the current rotation count
        would be two.
    </p>

    <p> <code>getAuthentication</code> returns the verification method for
        authentication. This result is used to populate the
        <code>authentication</code> section in the DID document during
        resolution.
    </p>

    <p> <code>getService</code> returns the single service endpoint. This
        result is used to populate the <code>service</code> section in the DID
        document during resolution.
    </p>
    <section>
    <h4>Identifying the DID Manager</h4>
    <p> The process for reliably identifying the corresponding DID Manager will
        differ between account address-based DIDs and smart contract
        address-based DIDs. In both cases, the address is first extracted from
        the DID using the <code>address</code> ABNF rule.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Account address-based DIDs</b>: In the case of an account address,
        the DID Manager smart contract is defined as the first smart contract
        that (1) is deployed by the account and (2) implements TZIP-19. The
        resolver must exhaustively query for any matching smart contract by
        either by (recommended) using a Tezos transaction indexer or scanning
        all Tezos transactions directly.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Smart contract address-based DIDs</b>: In the case of a smart
        contract address, the smart contract itself is the DID Manager, and
        must therefore implement TZIP-19. If it does not implement TZIP-19,
        then resolution will fail. 
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h4>Deriving DID Documents</h4>
    <p> The verification method used for authentication is produced by calling
        the <code>getAuthentication</code> smart contract function. No input
        parameters are required. The single service endpoint and its type is
        retrieved by calling the <code>getService</code> smart contract
        function.  These values are the only smart contract-sourced data used
        for Tezos DID resolution, and are substituted into a valid DID
        document.
    </p>

    <h3>Off-Chain DID Document Updates</h3>
    <p> Off-chain updates to the DID document are possible by specifying one or
        more signed patches in the DID resolution input metadata property named
        <code>updates</code> containing an array. If updates are present, they
        must all be of the same type.
    </p>
    <p> The two allowed types for updates are (1) unsigned Tezos transactions
        with valid <code>RotationSignature</code> parameter values that would
        correctly update the DID Manager if signed and cleared in a block and
        (2)
        <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/master/parameters/signed-ietf-json-patch.md"><code>signed-ietf-json-patch</code></a>
        restricted to changes possible through the DID Manager abstract
        function interface. These two types of updates have different privacy
        and security implications.

      <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
      <section>
      <h4>Eavesdropping</h4>
      <p>All exchanged data is public.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Replay</h4>
      <p> As the signed rotation events contain the chain ID, it is impossible
          for an attacker to deploy and replay the DID manager on a different
          chain.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Message Insertion</h4>
      <p>Events are signed.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Deletion</h4>
      <p> With the lack of real deletion, it means that the history of rotations
          (and thus previous verification methods and services) will stay public
          on the blockchain.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Modification</h4>
      <p> Similarly to the deletion, as the DID manager resides on a blockchain,
          it means that previous rotations will be forever public.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Man-in-the-Middle</h4>
      <p> When a third-party creates or update the DID manager, the event has to
          have a valid signature, meaning the user is in control of any change.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Denial of Service</h4>
      <p> The only remote request happening in the DID resolution is the DID
          management interactions, and as it is a smart contract it benefits
          from the Tezos blockchain's guarantees.

      <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
      <p> The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST
          discuss any subsection of section 5 of [RFC6973] that could apply in
          a method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are:
          surveillance, stored data compromise, unsolicited traffic,
          misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary use,
          disclosure, exclusion.
      </p>
      <section>
      <h4>Surveillance</h4>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Stored data compromise</h4>
      <p> All stored data in the DID manager is considered public (at the time of
          rotation).
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Unsolicited traffic</h4>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Misattribution</h4>
      <p> The resolution benefits from the Tezos blockchain (and in this case
          addresses) to avoid any ambiguity in the resolution.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Correlation</h4>
      <p>In a way, correlation is the goal of DID resolution.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Identification</h4>
      <p> The user could add a service that would link to another of their
